## What is this?
Basically just another security bot, it scans all messages for links and if the link is malicious it will flag that message. After 3 malicious links sent by the same user, the user will get kicked.

This was the first async code that I have written so it's bad and on top of that the "database" is a json file... so obviously if anyone wants to actually use this they would have to change some stuff :D
I might work on this and improve it in the future, but no guarantees!
